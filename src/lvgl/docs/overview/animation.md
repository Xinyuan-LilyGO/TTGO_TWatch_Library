# Animations

You can automatically change the value of a variable between a start and an end value using animations.
The animation will happen by periodically calling an "animator" function with the corresponding value parameter.

The *animator* functions have the following prototype:
```c
void func(void * var, lv_anim_var_t value);
```
This prototype is compatible with the majority of the *set* functions of LVGL. For example `lv_obj_set_x(obj, value)` or `lv_obj_set_width(obj, value)`


## Create an animation
To create an animation an `lv_anim_t` variable has to be initialized and configured with `lv_anim_set_...()` functions.

```c

/* INITIALIZE AN ANIMATION
 *-----------------------*/

lv_anim_t a;
lv_anim_init(&a);

/* MANDATORY SETTINGS
 *------------------*/

/*Set the "animator" function*/
lv_anim_set_exec_cb(&a, (lv_anim_exec_xcb_t) lv_obj_set_x); 

/*Set the "animator" function*/
lv_anim_set_var(&a, obj); 

/*Length of the animation [ms]*/
lv_anim_set_time(&a, duration);

/*Set start and end values. E.g. 0, 150*/
lv_anim_set_values(&a, start, end);

/* OPTIONAL SETTINGS
 *------------------*/

/*Time to wait before starting the animation [ms]*/
lv_anim_set_delay(&a, delay);

/*Set path (curve). Default is linear*/
lv_anim_set_path(&a, lv_anim_path_ease_in);

/*Set a callback to call when animation is ready.*/
lv_anim_set_ready_cb(&a, ready_cb);

/*Set a callback to call when animation is started (after delay).*/
lv_anim_set_start_cb(&a, start_cb);

/*Play the animation backward too with this duration. Default is 0 (disabled) [ms]*/
lv_anim_set_playback_time(&a, wait_time); 

/*Delay before playback. Default is 0 (disabled) [ms]*/
lv_anim_set_playback_delay(&a, wait_time);

/*Number of repetitions. Default is 1.  LV_ANIM_REPEAT_INFINIT for infinite repetition*/
lv_anim_set_repeat_count(&a, wait_time);

/*Delay before repeat. Default is 0 (disabled) [ms]*/
lv_anim_set_repeat_delay(&a, wait_time);

/*true (default): apply the start vale immediately, false: apply start vale after delay when then anim. really starts. */
lv_anim_set_early_apply(&a, true/false);

/* START THE ANIMATION
 *------------------*/
lv_anim_start(&a);                             /*Start the animation*/
```


You can apply multiple different animations on the same variable at the same time.
For example, animate the x and y coordinates with `lv_obj_set_x` and `lv_obj_set_y`. However, only one animation can exist with a given variable and function pair.
Therefore `lv_anim_start()` will delete the already existing variable-function animations.

## Animation path

You can determinate the path of animation. The most simple case is linear, meaning the current value between *start* and *end* is changed with fixed steps.
A *path* is a function which calculates the next value to set based on the current state of the animation. Currently, there are the following built-in paths functions:

- `lv_anim_path_linear` linear animation
- `lv_anim_path_step` change in one step at the end
- `lv_anim_path_ease_in` slow at the beginning
- `lv_anim_path_ease_out` slow at the end
- `lv_anim_path_ease_in_out` slow at the beginning and at the end
- `lv_anim_path_overshoot` overshoot the end value
- `lv_anim_path_bounce` bounce back a little from the end value (like hitting a wall)


## Speed vs time
By default, you set the animation time. But in some cases, setting the animation speed is more practical.

The `lv_anim_speed_to_time(speed, start, end)` function calculates the required time in milliseconds to reach the end value from a start value with the given speed.
The speed is interpreted in _unit/sec_ dimension. For example,  `lv_anim_speed_to_time(20,0,100)` will yield 5000 milliseconds. For example, in case of `lv_obj_set_x` *unit* is pixels so *20* means *20 px/sec* speed.

## Delete animations

You can delete an animation with `lv_anim_del(var, func)` if you provide the animated variable and its animator function.
